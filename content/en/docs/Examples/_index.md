  Demonstrations and tutorials to help you get to know COAsT.

The examples in `Notebooks` are tutorials automatically rendered from the python notebooks in [COAsT:examples_scripts/notebook_tutorials](https://github.com/British-Oceanographic-Data-Centre/COAsT/tree/master/example_scripts/notebook_tutorials).
These can be downloaded and run locally with the [example data](https://linkedsystems.uk/erddap/files/COAsT_example_files/). 

Within COAsT, configuration files are used to pass information about the example data files. The configuration files used
with the example data can be [downloaded](https://british-oceanographic-data-centre.github.io/COAsT/docs/getting-started/#example-configuration-files)
or linked to a local version of the [COAsT repository](https://github.com/British-Oceanographic-Data-Centre/COAsT/tree/master/config). 
These files should be placed in a ``config`` directory in your working directory, and form a useful template for loading new data files.
