  What is COAsT?
---

The Coastal Ocean Assessment Toolbox (COAsT) is a valuable Python package specifically designed to assist in the assessment, management, and analysis of high-resolution regional ocean model outputs. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities for analyzing and visualizing various aspects of coastal ocean data, delivering novel diagnostics for processes that emerge within these models.

## Key Features

- **High-Resolution Ocean Models**: COAsT is tailored to work with high-resolution regional ocean models

- **NEMO Integration**: The initial focus of COAsT is on delivering a limited number of novel diagnostics for [NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) configurations, a widely used ocean model. However, the toolbox is designed to be expanded to include other diagnostics and support for additional ocean models.

- **xarray Framework**: COAsT leverages the capabilities of the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) library to provide efficient and user-friendly data handling and analysis.

- **Community-Ready and Flexible**: The aim of COAsT is to create a toolbox that is ready for collaboration with the research community. It is designed to be flexible, allowing users to extend and adapt its functionalities to suit their specific research needs.

## Functionalities

- **Observation Data Co-processing and Management**: COAsT includes an expanding array of functions for reading and processing of ocean observational data types for co-analysis with simulation data. These data sources include satellite altimetry, tide gauges and in-situ profile data.

- **Visualization and Mapping**: COAsT offers tools for creating visual representations of your data through maps, graphs, and charts. It seamlessly integrates with popular libraries such as cartopy and matplotlib

- **Spatial Analysis**: COAsT provides robust spatial analysis tools for geospatial data analysis and statistical computations. For example flows across contours or transect, and computations over geographic regions using masks.

- **Statistical Analysis**: The package also offers a suite of statistical analysis capabilities
