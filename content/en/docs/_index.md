Coastal Ocean Assessment Toolbox (COAST) is a Python package specifically
designed to assist in the assessment, management and analysis of high resolution
regional ocean models outputs.

Here you can find information on obtaining, installing and using COAsT as well as guidelines
for contributing to the project.

This documentation site is still under construction but you can still find guidelines for
contributing to the package and this website. See below for description of each section.
